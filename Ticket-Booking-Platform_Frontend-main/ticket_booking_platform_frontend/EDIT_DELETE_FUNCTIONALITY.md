## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Enhanced ProductList Component**
```jsx
// New state management
const [editingProduct, setEditingProduct] = useState(null);
const [showDeleteConfirm, setShowDeleteConfirm] = useState(null);

// Edit handler
const handleEditProduct = async (productData) => {
  const result = await productService.updateProduct(editingProduct._id, productData);
  // Refresh products list after successful update
};

// Delete handler  
const handleDeleteProduct = async (productId) => {
  const result = await productService.deleteProduct(productId);
  // Move to recycle bin, refresh list
};
```

### **Enhanced AddProductForm Component**
```jsx
// Support for edit mode
const AddProductForm = ({ 
  onClose, 
  onSubmit, 
  isEdit = false, 
  initialData = null 
}) => {
  // Auto-populate form when editing
  useEffect(() => {
    if (isEdit && initialData) {
      setFormData(initialData);
    }
  }, [isEdit, initialData]);
};
```

### **Updated ProductService Methods**
```javascript
// Real API implementations
async updateProduct(id, productData) {
  // FormData with all product fields
  // PUT /api/ecom/products/:id
}

async deleteProduct(id) {
  // Move to recycle bin
  // DELETE /api/ecom/products/:id
}

async getRecycledProducts() {
  // Get deleted products
  // GET /api/ecom/products/recycled
}

async restoreProduct(id) {
  // Restore from recycle bin
  // PUT /api/ecom/products/:id/restore
}
```

## üåê **BACKEND API REQUIREMENTS**

### **1. Product Update Endpoint**
```
PUT /api/ecom/products/:id
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Authorization: Bearer {token}

FormData fields:
- name: string
- description: string  
- price: number
- quantity: number
- sku: string
- material: string
- careInstructions: string
- isActive: boolean
- sizes: JSON array ["S", "M", "L"]
- colors: JSON array ["Red", "Blue"]
- category: ObjectId
- images: File[] (optional)

Response:
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "Product updated successfully",
  "product": { ...updatedProduct }
}
```

### **2. Product Delete Endpoint (Move to Recycle Bin)**
```
DELETE /api/ecom/products/:id
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response:
{
  "status": "SUCCESS", 
  "message": "Product moved to recycle bin successfully"
}

Backend Logic:
- Set product.isDeleted = true
- Set product.deletedAt = new Date()
- Set product.deletedBy = userId
- Keep product in database (soft delete)
```

### **3. Get Recycled Products Endpoint**
```
GET /api/ecom/products/recycled
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response:
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "products": [
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "name": "Product Name",
      "isDeleted": true,
      "deletedAt": "2024-07-13T...",
      "deletedBy": "userId"
    }
  ]
}

Backend Logic:
- Find products where isDeleted = true
- Include deletedAt and deletedBy information
```

### **4. Restore Product Endpoint**
```
PUT /api/ecom/products/:id/restore
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response:
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "Product restored successfully",
  "product": { ...restoredProduct }
}

Backend Logic:
- Set product.isDeleted = false
- Remove deletedAt and deletedBy fields
- Product becomes active again
```

### **5. Permanent Delete Endpoint**
```
DELETE /api/ecom/products/:id/permanent
Authorization: Bearer {token}

Response:
{
  "status": "SUCCESS",
  "message": "Product permanently deleted"
}

Backend Logic:
- Actually remove product from database
- This action is irreversible
```
